Tape measure spring powered auto rewind spool holder

Current auto rewind spools use 3d printed plastic springs to rewind the spool. Bekindrewind uses a spring from a 6ft tape that will not fatigue and fail over time like a 3d printed spring. In an effort to make the project more accesible and cheaper it uses 3d printed bearings with standard 4.5mm BBs. The current design uses only one 608 bearing. 

# How it works
The spring coils inside the mandrel and rotates around the center shaft. Sprial traces with bbs rotate and allow for a determined number of rotations. After the number of rotations the center shaft and the spool holder lock together in one direction. A torque limiter located in the end bearing will become overloaded and rotate. Allowing the entire assembly to rotate with little more resistance than the spring.

# BOM
1 608 bearing

1 6ft "Master mechanic" tape measure (I have not tested other brands but its the cheapest one Ive found

~ 63 4.5mm bb gun bbs

2 3mm heatset inserts

2 M3*8

Printed parts

# Part settings
Normal voron settings worked for me. 40% infill with 4 outer lines

The only part that requires support is the larger hexigon part on the end bearings. This must be printed so that the inner circle is facing up and not an overhang as shown below

# Assembly

The end bearings require the most bbs and can be tedious. It is not represented in these pictures but the guide for the outer trace of bearings needs to face the opposite direction to load from the bottom. It does take an amount of force to persuade the bbs into the traces. The assembly requires 2 of the bearing assemblies however only one needs the torque limiter installed (located inside of the large hex)

Winding the spring into the mandrel is dangerous and requires some finess and patience. There are some videos on youtube on how to take apart the tape measure that I suggest you reaserch on your own. I highly suggest ppe. Gloves and safety glasses are a must. I had many cuts from the spring getting loose and very nearly lost an eye. So I cannot under state how decivingly dangerous it can be. As such I am not responsible for you ill advised experements. I might make a video in the future but as of now this is a beta test

I suggest using 1 of the spiral parts (Diagram shows 3) to make for 3 rotations. To many rotations can pull the spring out of the mandrel and force you to rebuild the spring assembly

assemble the mandrel and other parts as shown on the shaft then slide the assembly into the main cylinder. Screwing the end bearing into place as it inserts

Make sure everything spins freely and smoothly. I use 3 in 1 oil to lubricate all the parts that move. To set the torque limiter rotate the threaded hex until it is almost tight. Rotate the entire assembly to wind it up. It should rotate the 3 times without slipping. Loosen the nut and repeat the process until it slips when fully wound but not before. It can be a little tricky. 

I am wrapping electrical tape around the main body in order to attatch it to the spool for testing, there is currently no stand yet
